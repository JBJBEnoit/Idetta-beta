Very much still a work in progress, Idetta Maestro aims to combine a music practice scheduler with a 3D quest game full of musical challenges! The idea is that student would be rewarded with gameplay time, powerups or other in-game rewards for completed assigned practice or other assignments. The music instructors would have the ability to schedule practice sessions on student accounts (the server component is in a separate repo) and would be able to view the students' progress.

## Contributors Welcome!
Let me know if you are interested in contributing to this project, as I do not have the available time or expertise to bring this to production. In particular, 3D modelling and game design would be greatly appreciated, as I would prefer to replace the assets used with something better (these are only there for prototyping. I have an editor/level-building app for the game to share, if you are interested.
